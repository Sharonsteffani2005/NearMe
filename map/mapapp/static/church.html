â€‹St. Paul's Church, located on Hunters Road in Vepery, Chennai, is one of the city's oldest churches, established in 1858 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Built to serve the local Tamil-speaking Christian community, it was consecrated on September 18 of that year . The church is known for its Gothic Revival architecture, featuring pointed arches and stained-glass windows. It continues to be an active place of worship under the Church of South India (CSI), offering services in Tamil and English. In 2024, restoration efforts were initiated to preserve this historic landmark .
